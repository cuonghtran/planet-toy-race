# planet-toy-race

This is a simple game that you avoid obstacles and race through multiple planets. Be sure to look for portals to jump to other planets!

I made this game inspired by spherical gravity from games like Super Mario Galaxy. It's just a simple game that players running around planets and jumping 
to other planets when hit a portal. In this project, I got some models from Unity Store and used PolyBrush to draw them on the planets.
