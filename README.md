# planet-toy-race

This is a simple game that you avoid obstacles and race through multiple planets. Be sure to look for portals to jump to other planets!

This is the first 3D game I built, I made it inspired by spherical gravity from games like Super Mario Galaxy. It's just a simple game that players running around planets and jumping 
to other planets when hit a portal. I made this game by myself as a learning project. In this project, I got some models from Unity Store and used PolyBrush to draw them on the planets.

From the project, I learned how to control and manipulate the velocity, direction, gravity of objects. I learned how to use Polybrush to change terrain and draw objects on terrain. I also learn to do a simple lightmap to optimize performance.
